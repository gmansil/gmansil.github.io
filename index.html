      <h3>Getting Started:</h3>
      <p style="padding: 50px">If you have experience coding, go ahead and open up your preferred text editor. 
        For those without coding experience, look up <strong><a href="https://replit.com/">replit.com</a></strong>
        on a search engine. Create an account if you do not have one already. Now we can create a repl. When prompted
        for a search engine, type <strong>HTML, CSS, JS</strong>. This should auto generate three files for us.
      </p>
      <h3>HTML</h3>
      <div style="padding: 50px">
      <p>
        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used for creating
        web pages and applications. It allows developers to structure content on
        a web page by using various elements such as headings, paragraphs,
        lists, images, and links. HTML provides the basic structure of a web
        page and determines how the content should be displayed in a browser. It
        consists of tags enclosed in angle brackets that indicate what type of
        content is enclosed within them.
      </p>
      <p>If you're following along through a text editor, start by creating an HTML file: index.html. 
        View your file with a live server to see our web page change as we progress!
      </p>
      <p>
        Create a DOCTYPE(if you are using VS Code you can simply type "!" and hit
        tab. If not google "HTML doctype" and copy and paste. <strong>This is already in 
            the index.html file for people using replit.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Edit the title of your site by editing the title tag in the head of the file.</p>
      <p>
        Now in the scope of the body tag, create a heading using the <code>&lth1&gt</code> 
        which is known as the header tag and put your name in the contents.
      </p>
      <code style="margin-left: 100px;">&lth1&gtYour name&lt/h1&gt</code>
      <p>
        Create a paragraph using the <code>&ltp&gt tag</code> tag and add a few defining words
        about yourself.
      </p>
      <code style="margin-left:100px">&ltp&gtStudent and Future Occupation&lt/p&gt</code>
      <p>Create another paragraph and add a sentence about yourself</p>
      <p>
        <code style="margin-left: 100px;">
        &ltp&gtI am a student at Swarthmore College and an aspiring occupation.&ltp&gt
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now create a <code>&lthr&gt</code> to provide more structure to the page. Notice that
        the horizontal rule tag does not have a closing tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's now create another header but using the <code>&lth3&gt</code> tag instead this
        time and put "Education" in between the tags.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will now create a list using the <code>&ltul&gt tag</code>. To create a list item,
        enter the scope of your <code>&ltul&gt</code> tag and create a <code>&ltli&gt</code>. For each
        item of your list create a new <code>&ltli&gt</code>.
      </p>
      <code style="margin-left: 100px;">
        &ltul&gt 
        <p style="margin-left: 100px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ltli&gtHighschool at SECA&lt/li&gt</p> 
        <p style="margin-left: 100px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ltli&gtCurrently enrolled at Swarthmore&ltli&gt</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 100px;">&lt/ul&gt</p>
      </p>
      </code>
      <p>Create another subsection but this time for Work Experience. Each time we create a subsection, 
        use a horizontal rule to separate the content of your web page.
      </p>
      </div>
      <h3>CSS</h3>
      <div style="padding:50px";>
      <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a 
        document written in HTML. It provides a way for developers to define the visual appearance of 
        elements on a web page, including layout, colors, fonts, and sizes. By separating the presentation 
        of a web page from its content, CSS allows developers to make changes to the layout and appearance 
        of a web page without changing the underlying HTML code. CSS is written using a set of rules that define 
        the style of an element, which are then applied to the appropriate HTML elements. The latest version of 
        CSS is CSS3, which has introduced many new features such as animations, gradients, and transitions.
    </p>
    <p>Their are many ways to add styling to a website. Some websites have separate files which have styling instructions 
        that can be applied to tags. We will use in-line tagging for the sake of simplicity. This is an example of in-line styling:
    </p>
    <code style="margin-left: 100px;">&lthr size="3"&gt</code>
    <p>The styling for this horizontal rule is pretty straightforward. An important note is that the styling for this
        tag will not apply to any other horizontal tags.
    </p>
    <p>When using in-line styling, we can omit the style attribute if the styling isn't CSS styling. Changing the size of our 
        horizontal rule isn't specific to CSS.
    </p>
    <p> Add the following in-line styling to your <code>&lthr style=&gt</code> tag</p>
    <p><code style="margin-left: 100px;">
        border-style: none; border-top-style: dotted; border-color: gray; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;border-width: 5px; width: 5%;
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>If you want to change the background color of your website, add in-line styling to your <code>&ltbody color:40514E&gt</code></p>
    <p>Because of how the HTML has been structured, the body of the web page lies within the body tag limiting our styling options.
        A good way of thinking about modern web development is as a collection of rectangles which are created by the <code>&ltdiv&gt</code>
        tag. Web devlopment becomes complex when choosing the positioning of divs and ensuring that the flow of web page isn't awkward.
    </p>
      </div>
    <h3>Adding Images</h3>
    <div style="padding:50px">
    <p>Any modern day website uses images so we will use them too. Lets start by creating a folder called images. Add the image of your choice,
        can be a headshot or any random picture that you like, to your folder(you can drag and drop). </p>
        <p>Now back in our HTML file, we will create a image tag right above the heading with our name <code>&ltimg src="images/placeholder"&gt</code> and replace the 
            placeholder with the file path of the image. If you need help with this let me know. To add an image to a repl, upload the image from your computer. Depending 
            on how your image is saved, you may need to use a file converter (google an image converter).
    </p>
    <p>Depending on the image you have used, the size of the image can differ greatly based on the image's original dimensions or resolution. We can use in-line styling to
        limit the height and width of our image. <code>&ltimg src="images/placeholder" style="border-radius: 100%"&gt</code>. This makes our image circular which fits if you
        decided to use a headshot. Other ways of styling images is by editing their height or width. 
    </p>
    <p>Feel free to google styling for any of the tags used so far. You can also make your image smaller or larger depending on what is necessary for your webpage.</p>
    <p>If you would like to add more images of yourself playing sports or pets or anything of interest feel free to rinse and repeat. The placement of your images will drastically 
        change the format of your webpage.
